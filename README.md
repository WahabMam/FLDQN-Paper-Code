This repository contains the implementation and results for the FLDQN algorithm, as presented in the related research paper.

This repository contains the implementation code for the paper *"FLDQN: A Novel Approach for Efficient Agents Cooperation and Travel Time Minimization Using Federated Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and SUMO Simulation"*. The code demonstrates how FLDQN can reduce travel time through efficient learning.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WahabMam/FLDQN-Paper-Code/tree/main
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd FLDQN-Paper-Code

3. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Ensure you have SUMO installed version(1.14.1), as it is required for traffic simulation.
    
You need to install [SUMO](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/) based on your operating system:

- [Download for Windows](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing/Windows_Build.html)
- [Download for Linux](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing/Linux_Build.html)
- [Download for macOS](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing/MacOS_Build.html)

5. Modify the parameters in the config.yaml and in the server.py files to match your system's specifications and your desired settings.
6. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your dependencies and avoid conflicts with other packages on your system.
